**I will probably not continue this project**

This is a project that I use to become familiar with developing plug-ins for Eclipse. Once I feel that I covered all aspects of plug-in building I will check with the guys from the eclihx project to see if we can start a collaboration.

Update: Currently on hold, will probably use xText and xBase as base when xBase is released (see http://blog.efftinge.de/2010/09/xbase-new-programming-language.html)
